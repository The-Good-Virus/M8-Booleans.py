# M8-Booleans.py
This module requires a Python program to solve seven problems using logical conditions and booleans. You'll create functions for equality checks, sum evaluations, list searches, and leap year determination. You'll also implement a Character class with items/weaknesses and check task requirements. Lastly, test, debug, and document your code.
