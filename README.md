# M8-Booleans.py
This module requires a Python program to solve seven problems using logical conditions and booleans. You'll create functions for equality checks, sum evaluations, list searches, and leap year determination. You'll also implement a Character class with items/weaknesses and check task requirements. Lastly, test, debug, and document your code.
Refering back to module 1 I now understand the importance and have a little more patients for debugging. When it came to creating this code I ran into more errors than I'd like to see and it involved a lot of constructing and deconstructing to get to pythons liking and to successfully run the code. At the end it's best to record your mistakes because you'll save yourself the trouble of having to find the solution when it's right in your book or where ever you recorded the previous code's errors.
